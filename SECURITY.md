# Security Policy

## Overview

This repository contains code that is provided as a static, one-off release. Examples of such releases include code accompanying a publication, standalone code releases, or code provided alongside other products. As such, it is provided "as-is" and is not actively maintained. While we strive to follow best practices in security, we do not guarantee that the code is free from vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to review and assess the code for their own use cases.

## Security Updates

We do not commit to regular security updates or patches for this repository. The code and its dependencies may not be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities. Users should be aware of this and take appropriate precautions when using the code in their own environments.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us. While we may not be able to address all reported issues due to the nature of this repository, we appreciate your efforts to help improve the security of the code.

To report a vulnerability, please email us at [taejin.park@bis.org](mailto:taejin.park@bis.org) with the details of the issue. Include as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the vulnerability.
