# Large language models: a primer for economists

This repository accompanies our paper, **“Large language models: a primer for economists”**, authored by Byeungchun Kwon, Taejin Park, Fernando Perez-Cruz, and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul.

The publication provides an accessible introduction to LLMs aimed at economists and offers applied researchers a practical walkthrough of their use. You can access the full paper here: [LINK].

**Repository Overview**

Due to restrictions on the proprietary data used in the original research, this repository utilises a different sample dataset from ArXiv, which is open-source and features topics unrelated to the original study. Additionally, to minimise computational demands, we employ smaller datasets and models for illustration purposes. While the procedures outlined below closely mirror the actual analysis, the data, models, examples, and outcomes presented here differ from those in the paper.
